# Snow Mountain

this website was a skills exercise with html and css designed to help us better
understand the basic concepts of web design, this page was built off a user
interface design mock provided by the instructors. Adobe XD was used with the
mocks to pull individual elements, colors, and styles.

#### design

I implemented css grid for the images used on the website i also used flex-box
to properly space the bottom logos and contact info.
